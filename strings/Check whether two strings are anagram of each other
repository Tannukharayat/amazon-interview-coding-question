**Write a function to check whether two given strings are anagram of each other or not. An anagram of a string is another string 
that contains same characters, only the order of characters can be different. For example, “abcd” and “dabc” are anagram of each
other.*

                
Method 1 (Use Sorting)
Time Complexity: O(nLogn)
Sort both strings
Compare the sorted strings

Method 2 (Count characters)

Method 3 (count charcters using one array)
