Stream of binary number is coming, the task is to tell the number formed so far is divisible by a given number n.
At any given time, you will get 0 or 1 and tell whether the number formed with these bits is divisible by n or not.


  void CheckDivisibility2(int n) 
{ 
    int num = 0; 
    std::cout << "press any key other than"
                " 0 and 1 to terminate \n"; 
    while (true) 
    { 
        int incomingBit; 
  
        // read next incoming bit via standard 
        // input. 0, 00, 000.. are same as int 0 
        // ans 1, 01, 001, 00..001 is same as 1. 
        std::cin >> incomingBit; 
  
        // Update value of num formed so far 
        if (incomingBit == 1) 
            num = (num * 2 + 1); 
        else if (incomingBit == 0) 
            num = (num * 2); 
  
        else
            break; 
        if (num % n == 0) 
            std::cout << "yes \n"; 
        else
            std::cout << "no \n"; 
    } 
} 

OR
void CheckDivisibility(int n) 
{ 
    int remainder = 0; 
    std::cout << "press any key other than 0"
                 " and 1 to terminate \n"; 
    while (true) 
    { 
        // Read next incoming bit via standard 
        // input. 0, 00, 000.. are same as int 0 
        // ans 1, 01, 001, 00..001 is same as 1. 
        int incomingBit; 
        cin >> incomingBit; 
  
        // Update remainder 
        if (incomingBit == 1) 
            remainder = (remainder * 2 + 1) % n; 
        else if (incomingBit == 0) 
            remainder = (remainder * 2) % n; 
        else
            break; 
  
        // If remainder is 0. 
        if (remainder % n == 0) 
            cout << "yes \n"; 
        else
            cout << "no \n"; 
    } 
}
