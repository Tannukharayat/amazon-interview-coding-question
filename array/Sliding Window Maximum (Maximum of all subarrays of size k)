Given an array and an integer K, find the maximum for each and every contiguous subarray of size k.

Method 2: This method uses the uses the Self-Balancing BST to solve the given problem.(AVL TREE)
Compelxity Analysis:
Time Complexity: O(N * Log k).
Insertion, deletion and search takes log k time in a AVL tree. So the overall time Complexity is O(N * log k)
Space Compelxity: O(k).
The space required to store k elements in a BST is O(k).

Method 3: This method uses Deque to solve the above problem.
Algorithm :
Create a deque to store k elements.
Run a loop and insert first k elements in the deque. While inserting the element if the element at the back of the queue is smaller than the current element remove all those elements and then insert the element.
Now, run a loop from k to end of the array.
Print the front element of the array
Remove the element from the front of the queue if they are out of the current window.
Insert the next element in the deque. While inserting the element if the element at the back of the queue is smaller than the current element remove all those elements and then insert the element.
Print the maximum element of the last window

void printKMax(int arr[], int n, int k) 
{ 
    // Create a Double Ended Queue, Qi that will store indexes of array elements 
    // The queue will store indexes of useful elements in every window and it will 
    // maintain decreasing order of values from front to rear in Qi, i.e., 
    // arr[Qi.front[]] to arr[Qi.rear()] are sorted in decreasing order 
    std::deque<int> Qi(k); 
  
    /* Process first k (or first window) elements of array */
    int i; 
    for (i = 0; i < k; ++i) { 
        // For every element, the previous smaller elements are useless so 
        // remove them from Qi 
        while ((!Qi.empty()) && arr[i] >= arr[Qi.back()]) 
            Qi.pop_back(); // Remove from rear 
  
        // Add new element at rear of queue 
        Qi.push_back(i); 
    } 
  
    // Process rest of the elements, i.e., from arr[k] to arr[n-1] 
    for (; i < n; ++i) { 
        // The element at the front of the queue is the largest element of 
        // previous window, so print it 
        cout << arr[Qi.front()] << " "; 
  
        // Remove the elements which are out of this window 
        while ((!Qi.empty()) && Qi.front() <= i - k) 
            Qi.pop_front(); // Remove from front of queue 
  
        // Remove all elements smaller than the currently 
        // being added element (remove useless elements) 
        while ((!Qi.empty()) && arr[i] >= arr[Qi.back()]) 
            Qi.pop_back(); 
  
        // Add current element at the rear of Qi 
        Qi.push_back(i); 
    } 
  
    // Print the maximum element of last window 
    cout << arr[Qi.front()]; 
} 

Compelxity Analysis:
Time Complexity: O(n).
It seems more than O(n) at first look. It can be observed that every element of array is added and removed at most once. So there are total 2n operations.
Auxiliary Space: O(k).
Elements stored in the dequeue take O(k) space.

Method 4: This method uses Max-Heap to solve the above problem.
Complexity Analysis:
Time Complexity: O(n * k).
The time complexity of steps 4(a) is O(k), 4(b) is O(Log(k)) and it is in a loop that runs (n â€“ k + 1) times. Hence, the time complexity of the complete algorithm is O((k + Log(k)) * n) i.e. O(n * k).
Space Complexity: O(k).
To store the elements in Heap O(k) space is used.
