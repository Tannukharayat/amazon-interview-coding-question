Given an array of n integers. Each array element is obtained by adding either +1 or -1 to previous element i.e absolute 
difference between any two consecutive elements is 1. The task is to search an element index with the minimum number of 
comparison (less than simple element by element search). If the element is present multiple time, then print the smallest index. If the element is not present print -1.

Examples:

Input : arr[] = {5, 4, 5, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2} 
        x = 4.
Output : 1
The first occurrence of element x is at 
index 1.


    int search(int arr[], int n, int x) 
    { 
        // Searching x in arr[0..n-1] 
        int i = 0; 
        while (i <= n-1) 
        { 
            // Checking if element is found. 
            if (arr[i] == x) 
                return i; 

            // Else jumping to abs(arr[i]-x). 
            i += abs(arr[i]-x); 
        } 

        return -1; 
    }
