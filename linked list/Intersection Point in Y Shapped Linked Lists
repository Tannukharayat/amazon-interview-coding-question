**There are two singly linked lists of size N and M in a system. But, due to some programming error the end node of one of the linked list
got linked into one of the node of second list, forming a inverted Y shaped list. Write a program to get the point where two linked lists 
intersect each other ****

      int intersectPoint(Node* head1, Node* head2)
      {
          Node* temp1 = head1;
          Node* temp2 = head2;
          while(temp1 != temp2)
          {
              if(temp1==NULL)
              temp1=head2;
              else temp1=temp1->next;

              if(temp2==NULL)
              temp2=head1;
              else temp2=temp2->next;
          }
         return temp1->data;
      }
