Approach: It is a variation of LIS problem. The following are the steps to solve the problem.
    1. Sort the north-south pairs on the basis of increasing order of south x-coordinates.
    2. If two south x-coordinates are same, then sort on the basis of increasing order of north x-coordinates.
    3. Now find the Longest Increasing Subsequence of the north x-coordinates.
    4. One thing to note that in the increasing subsequence a value can be greater as well as can be equal to its previous value.
