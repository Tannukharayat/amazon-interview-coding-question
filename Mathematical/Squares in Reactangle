**Charlie loves squares. So his friend Jack gives him a task to completely fill a rectangle of size AxB using squares of any sizes such 
that no two squares overlap. Now charlie wants to use minimum number of squares to complete this task. He needs help to count minimum number
of squares to complete this task. The task is to find the minimum number of squares needed to fill the rectangle.**
