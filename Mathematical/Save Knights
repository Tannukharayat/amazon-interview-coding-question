**How many non-attacking knights K(n) can be placed on an n x n chessboard. 
Recall that a knight can attack another knight if their vertical distance on the chessboard is 2 and their horizontal distance 
is 1, or if their vertical distance is 1 and their horizontal distance is 2. Only one knight may be placed on each square of the
chessboard.**

        int main() 
        {
          int t ;
          cin >> t ;
          while(t--)
          {
              int n ;
              cin >> n ;
              if(n==1)
              {
                  cout<<"1"<<endl;
                  continue;
              }
              if(n==2)
              cout<<"4"<<endl;
              else
              cout<<((n*n)+1)/2<<endl;
          }
          return 0;
        }
