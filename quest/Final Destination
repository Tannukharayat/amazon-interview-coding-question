Consider a 2d plane and  a Robot which is located at (0,0) who can move only one unit step at a time in any direction  ie if its initial 
position is (x,y)  he can go to positions (x + 1, y), (x - 1, y), (x, y + 1) or (x, y - 1). Now Given three integers a,b (denoting the 
final position where the robot has
 to reach)  and x (denoting the steps in which he has to reach).
 
 
 int main() 
{
	int t ;
	cin >> t ;
	while(t--)
	{
	    int n , m , x ;
	    cin >> n >> m >> x;
	    x=x-(abs(n)+abs(m));
	    if(x<0||x%2!=0)
	    {
	        cout<<"0"<<endl;
	    }else cout<<"1"<<endl;
	}
	return 0;
}
