Given an integer n, write a function that returns count of trailing zeroes in n!.
Examples :

Input: n = 5
Output: 1 
Factorial of 5 is 120 which has one trailing 0.

Input: n = 20
Output: 4
Factorial of 20 is 2432902008176640000 which has
4 trailing zeroes.

Input: n = 100
Output: 24

  Trailing 0s in n! = Count of 5s in prime factors of n!
                  = floor(n/5) + floor(n/25) + floor(n/125) + ....
int findTrailingZeros(int n) 
{ 
    // Initialize result 
    int count = 0; 
  
    // Keep dividing n by powers of  
    // 5 and update count 
    for (int i = 5; n / i >= 1; i *= 5) 
        count += n / i; 
  
    return count; 
}
