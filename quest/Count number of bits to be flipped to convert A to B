Given two numbers ‘a’ and b’. Write a program to count number of bits needed to be flipped to convert ‘a’ to ‘b’.
Example :

Input : a = 10, b = 20
Output : 4
Binary representation of a is 00001010
Binary representation of b is 00010100
We need to flip highlighted four bits in a
to make it b.


    int countSetBits(int n) 
        { 
            int count = 0; 
            while (n > 0) 
            { 
                count++; 
                n &= (n-1); 
            } 
            return count; 
        } 

        // Function that return count of 
        // flipped number 
        int FlippedCount(int a, int b) 
        { 
            // Return count of set bits in 
            // a XOR b 
            return countSetBits(a^b); 
        } 
        
        oR
        
        int countBits(int a, int b) 
        { 

            // To store the required count 
            int count = 0; 

            // Loop until both of them become zero 
            while (a || b) { 

                // Store the last bits in a 
                // as well as b 
                int last_bit_a = a & 1; 
                int last_bit_b = b & 1; 

                // If the current bit is not same 
                // in both the integers 
                if (last_bit_a != last_bit_b) 
                    count++; 

                // Right shift both the integers by 1 
                a = a >> 1; 
                b = b >> 1; 
            } 

            // Return the count 
            return count; 
        }
