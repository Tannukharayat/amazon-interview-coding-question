Transpose of a matrix is obtained by changing rows to columns and columns to rows. In other words, transpose of A[][] is 
obtained by changing A[i][j] to A[j][i].

In-Place for Square Matrix:

  void transpose(int A[][N]) 
{ 
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) 
        for (int j = i+1; j < N; j++) 
            swap(A[i][j], A[j][i]); 
}
